SwasthyaX provides users with full control over their data. In accordance with Google Play's Data Safety requirements, this page outlines the process for requesting the deletion of your account and associated data.

## How to Delete Your Account

You can request account deletion through two methods:

2. Go to the **Profile** tab.
3. Tap on **Settings** (Gear icon).
4. Select **Account Security** or **Edit Profile**.
5. Tap **Delete Account**.
6. Confirm your choice. Your account and data will be deleted immediately from our active databases.

### 2. Request via Web/Email
